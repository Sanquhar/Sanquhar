# About Me

I am a Master's student in **Data Science** at **EPFL**, with a specialization in **Financial Engineering**.  
With a strong background in Communication Systems, I have a deep interest in statistics, stochastic modeling, and machine learning — especially their applications in quantitative finance. I enjoy coding, solving complex problems, and delivering rigorous, detail-oriented work.
