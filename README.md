# About Me

I am a Master's student in **Data Science** at **EPFL**, with a specialization in **Financial Engineering**.  
With a strong background in Communication Systems, I have a deep interest in statistics, stochastic modeling, and machine learning — especially their applications in quantitative finance. I enjoy coding, solving complex problems, and delivering rigorous, detail-oriented work.

## Projects

### Academic Projects (EPFL)

1. **[ada-2024-project-bada55](https://github.com/your-username/ada-2024-project-bada55)**
   - **Description**: This project analyzes beer review platforms (BeerAdvocate vs. RateBeer) by comparing their characteristics based on expert users. We investigated user behavior and provided platform recommendations based on user profiles. 
   - **Technologies**: Gensim, Matplotlib, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, Pillow, Plotly, Scipy, Seaborn, SpaCy, Statsmodels, VaderSentiment, WordCloud

2. **[ml-project-2-the-3-nearest-neighbors-1](https://github.com/your-username/ml-project-2-the-3-nearest-neighbors-1)**
   - **Description**: In this project, we tackled the problem of identifying roads in images by predicting a mask that distinguishes roads (white) from non-roads (black). 
   - **Technologies**: PyTorch, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib

3. **[ml-project-1-the-3-nearest-neighbors](https://github.com/your-username/ml-project-1-the-3-nearest-neighbors)**
   - **Description**: This project focused on cardiovascular disease detection. We implemented various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Ridge Regression, with different variations to improve accuracy in predicting the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.
   - **Technologies**: Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


### Personal & Side Projects

1. **[Market Prediction App](https://market-p8qwtca6ent3mcsqvkfrkc.streamlit.app/)**
   - **Description**: A web application built with Streamlit to predict the closing prices of stock tickers (such as AAPL, TSLA, MSFT) based on historical data. The app uses graphical analysis techniques, including moving averages and stock variance, calculated from the previous 20 days of data.
   - **Models**: Two basic models are currently implemented:
     - A **simple MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron)** model.
     - A basic **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model.
   - **Current Limitations**: The app is still in development. Improvements are needed in the user interface, model refinement (cross-validation), and feature engineering (combining data from multiple stocks and analyzing correlations).
